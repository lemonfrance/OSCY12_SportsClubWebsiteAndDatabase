# OSCY12_SportsClubWebsiteAndDatabase
A sports club website and database project I did for an external assessment in high school (2017). Aside from the website visible to visitors, this also has semi full-fledged, logged-in administrator features that allow making changes to the website's appearance.

Follow these steps to test the website and its features:

SETTING UP WAMPSERVER
1. Download Wampserver (x64) with default settings. Create a shortcut on your Desktop.
2. Run Wampserver by double-clicking on the shortcut on your Desktop. You should see the Wampserver logo around the right area of your taskbar. Wait for it to turn green.

SETTING UP THE DATABASE
1. Click on the Wampserver icon on your taskbar. A small window appears with a list of options. Open PHPMyAdmin.
2. In the Databases tab, create a database called "kiwi_ormiston". Then, in the Import tab, choose the 'kiwi_ormiston.sql' file.

SETTING UP THE WEBSITE
1. In the 'wamp64' folder, in the 'www' folder, put in all PHP and image folders and files.
2. On your browser, go to http://localhost/koac_index16.php.

And now the website is functional.
